# NLP_Fake_News_Detector

In this hands-on project from the platform Coursera https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-fake-news-detector/home/welcome, we train a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM based deep learning model to detect fake news from a given news corpus. This project could be practically used by any media company to automatically predict whether the circulating news is fake or not. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of news related articles.
